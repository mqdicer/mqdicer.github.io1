Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Fotini Christia"],"categories":null,"content":"You can read the Lorenz Goette and Stephan Meier\u0026rsquo;s comment here.\nMIT News news article Bridging the Divide covered this research here, as well as referring to it in Studying Conflict from the Ground Up here.\n","date":1323406800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1323406800,"objectID":"8e943387e179f0fe7cc64f86211c300f","permalink":"https://mqdicer.github.io/publication/context_modularity_of_altruism/","publishdate":"2011-12-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/context_modularity_of_altruism/","section":"publication","summary":"Whereas altruism drives the evolution of human cooperation, ethno-religious diversity has been considered to obstruct it, leading to poverty, corruption, and war. We argue that current research has failed to properly account for the institutional environment and how it affects the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving, diverse communities throughout human history suggests that diversity does not always lead to cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a critical historic moment in the city's postwar history. Using a public goods game, we found that the ability to sanction is key to achieving cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in segregated ones. Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a real-life setting that institutions of integration can unleash human altruism and restore cooperation in the presence of diversity.","tags":["cooperation","field experiments","behavioral economics","experiments"],"title":"Context modularity of human altruism","type":"publication"}]
