# about me

I work as a Research Scientist in the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net) at the [Yale Institute for Network Science](https://yins.yale.edu), directed by [Nicholas A. Christakis](https://nicholaschristakis.net). My research is on genomics of social networks, evolution of cooperation, and network interventions to improve and extend human life. I received my education and training at [Yale](https://yale.edu), [Oxford](http://ox.ac.uk), [Harvard](https://harvard.edu) and [Stanford](https://stanford.edu). Before coming to Yale, I did postdoc research on engineering induced pluripotent stem cells and their epigenomics, as well as completed 2 years of MD science coursework at [Stanford Medical School](https://med.stanford.edu).

My research combines bench work, computation, and field experiments. I am interested in biological foundations of human sociality and how that can help us improve lives and create healthier communities. Our largest project aims to reduce infant and maternal mortality in villages in the Western highlands of Honduras, one of the most isolated, dangerous and poorly developed places on our planet. That project is supported by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and the [International Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en).
