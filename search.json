We argue that current research has failed to properly account for the institutional environment and how it affects the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving, diverse communities throughout human history suggests that diversity does not always lead to cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a critical historic moment in the city's postwar history. Using a public goods game, we found that the ability to sanction is key to achieving cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in segregated ones. Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a real-life setting that institutions of integration can unleash human altruism and restore cooperation in the presence of diversity.","tags":["cooperation","field experiments","behavioral economics","experiments"],"title":"Context modularity of human altruism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Nicholas A.

Similar to other forecasting experts, physicians face different costs depending on whether their best forecasts prove to be an overestimate or an underestimate of the true probabilities of an event. We provide the first empirical characterization of physicians' loss functions. We find that even the physicians' subjective belief distributions over outcomes are not well calibrated, with the loss characterized by asymmetry in favor of over-predicting patients' survival. We show that the physicians' bias is further increased by (1) reduction of the belief distributions to point forecasts, (2) communication of the forecast to the patient, and (3) physicians' own past experience and reputation.","tags":["behavioral economics","health","medicine","data science"],"title":"Bias and Asymmetric Loss in Expert Forecasts: A Study of Physician Prognostic Behavior with Respect to Patient Survival","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Matthew C.

However, little discussion appears to focus explicitly on quantifying the cost of economic crises in terms of human lives, especially the lives of the most vulnerable members of society, infants. Using a statistical approach that is robust to the increases of mortality in outlying years, we quantify the effect that economic crises, periods of prolonged economic recession, have on infant mortality. Moreover, we investigate whether different levels of public spending on health across advanced industrialized democracies can mitigate the impact of crises on infant mortality. We find that economic crises are extremely costly and lead to a more than proportional increase in infant mortality in the short-run. Substantial public spending on health is required in order to limit their impact.","tags":["quantile regression","infant mortality","economics"],"title":"Quantifying the Impact of Economic Crises on Infant Mortality in Advanced Economies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcus Alexander","Matthew C.

Quantile regression offers a robust, and therefore efficient alternative to least squares estimation. We show that quantile regression can be used in the presence of endogenous covariates, and can also account for unobserved individual effects. Moreover, the estimation of these models is no more demanding today than that of a least squares model. We use quantile regression methods to re-examine the hypothesis that higher income leads to democracy, obtaining a series of new insights not available under traditional approaches.","tags":["economics","quantile regression","instrumental variables","data science"],"title":"Quantile Regression for Time-Series-Cross-Section Data","type":"publication"}]
